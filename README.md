# Microsoft SQL JDBC for Minecraft

Microsoft SQL JDBC driver for use as an external library/optional dependency by other projects.

* This mod doesn't do anything by itself - but it can be used by other mods that need JDBC.
* This mod is a direct repackage of the [official Microsoft SQL connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server) with added mod metadata to allow it to be loaded as a mod or plugin.
* There are no modifications to the underlying JDBC driver.

This mod is a universal JAR and runs on all versions of Forge/Fabric/Spigot from 1.12.2 to current.
